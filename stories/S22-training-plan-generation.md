# S22 — Training plan generation

## User story

As a **runner**,
I want to **describe my goal race and have the app generate a personalised weekly training plan**
so that **every session I do between now and race day is purposeful, load-appropriate, and grounded in my actual fitness**.

## Acceptance criteria

### Race wizard
- [ ] User can create a "goal race" with: race name, distance (preset list + custom km), date, terrain (road / trail / track), elevation gain (optional), goal finish time (optional), priority level (A/B/C race)
- [ ] Multiple goal races can exist; only one is "active" at a time
- [ ] Races are stored in SQLite (races table) and editable/deletable
- [ ] Weeks-to-race is computed automatically from today's date and shown to the user before generation

### Plan generation
- [ ] User triggers plan generation from the race detail screen; a confirmation screen shows what context will be used (race info, profile fields, training history window)
- [ ] The app assembles a generation prompt from: athlete profile (S05), last 8 weeks of training summary (extended window vs. the usual 4), all pinned insights (S07), goal race details, and a structured plan schema description
- [ ] The generation prompt is sent to the currently configured LLM backend (S09/S10/S11) via the existing LLM interface
- [ ] The LLM response is parsed into a structured plan: N weeks x 7 days, each day having zero or one session
- [ ] Each session contains: session type (easy / tempo / intervals / long run / strength / rest), target duration (minutes), target distance (km, optional), target HR zone (1-5, optional), target pace range (optional), notes/description (free text, max 300 chars)
- [ ] The app validates the parsed plan (no missing required fields, sane durations, race week is the final week) and retries the LLM call up to 2 times on parse failure before surfacing an error
- [ ] Generated plan is saved to SQLite and linked to the race record

### Plan UI
- [ ] A "Training Plan" top-level section appears in the navigation once a plan exists
- [ ] Default view is a weekly calendar: columns = Mon-Sun, rows = weeks, each cell shows session type + duration as a colour-coded chip
- [ ] Clicking a session opens a detail panel: all session fields, editable notes
- [ ] User can mark a session as: completed, skipped, or modified (with actual duration/distance recorded)
- [ ] A weekly summary bar shows planned vs. actual volume for the week
- [ ] Weeks in the past are visually distinguished from upcoming weeks
- [ ] Clicking "Regenerate plan" from the race detail triggers a new LLM call with the same inputs plus a diff note

### Plan as context
- [ ] The active training plan is included as a new context block in the prompt assembler (S08), slotted between the profile block and training summary block
- [ ] The plan block includes: race name, date, weeks remaining, current week's sessions, next week's sessions — no more (token budget respected)
- [ ] Pinned insights remain highest priority; plan block is compressed before the training summary block

### Adjustment chat
- [ ] From any session detail, user can open a chat pre-seeded with "I want to adjust this session: [session details]"
- [ ] The full coaching context (including plan block) is present so the LLM can suggest a coherent swap

## Technical notes

### New packages and files

  internal/plan/generator.go     — prompt assembly + LLM call + response parsing
  internal/plan/schema.go        — Go structs: Race, TrainingPlan, Week, Session, SessionStatus
  internal/plan/storage.go       — SQLite CRUD for races and plans
  internal/plan/context_block.go — formats the active plan for context assembly (S08)
  frontend/src/lib/PlanCalendar.svelte
  frontend/src/lib/SessionDetail.svelte
  frontend/src/lib/RaceWizard.svelte
  frontend/src/lib/PlanSummaryBar.svelte
  app.go                         — new Wails bindings (see below)

### SQLite schema

  races table: id (UUID PK), name, distance_km, race_date, terrain (road/trail/track), elevation_m (nullable), goal_time_s (nullable), priority (A/B/C), is_active, created_at
  training_plans table: id, race_id (FK), generated_at, llm_backend, prompt_hash (SHA-256)
  plan_weeks table: id, plan_id (FK), week_number, week_start; UNIQUE(plan_id, week_number)
  plan_sessions table: id, week_id (FK), day_of_week (1-7), session_type, duration_min, distance_km, hr_zone (1-5), pace_min_low, pace_min_high, notes, status (planned/completed/skipped/modified), actual_duration_min, actual_distance_km, completed_at

### Wails bindings (app.go)

  CreateRace(r plan.Race) (plan.Race, error)
  UpdateRace(r plan.Race) error
  DeleteRace(id string) error
  ListRaces() ([]plan.Race, error)
  SetActiveRace(id string) error
  GeneratePlan(raceID string) (plan.TrainingPlan, error)
  GetActivePlan() (*plan.TrainingPlan, error)
  GetPlanWeeks(planID string) ([]plan.Week, error)
  UpdateSessionStatus(sessionID string, status plan.SessionStatus, actual plan.ActualMetrics) error

### LLM prompt structure

The generation prompt instructs the LLM to return a JSON object matching the plan schema. System prompt establishes the LLM as an expert running coach and states that only valid JSON must be returned (no prose wrapping). Parse with encoding/json. If json.Unmarshal fails, strip markdown code fences and retry before counting as a failure. Log the raw LLM response on every parse failure.

### Context block (S08 integration)

PlanBlock() formats: race name, date, weeks remaining, current week sessions, next week sessions. Capped at 400 tokens. Slot: after profile block, before training summary block.

### Session type colour coding

  easy → green-400
  long_run → blue-500
  tempo → orange-400
  intervals → red-500
  strength → purple-400
  rest → gray-200
  race → yellow-500

## Tests required

- Unit — plan/schema.go: struct validation (missing required fields, out-of-range HR zone, past race date)
- Unit — plan/storage.go: race CRUD, plan CRUD, session status updates, active race constraint, cascade delete
- Unit — plan/generator.go: prompt assembly (correct fields, token count within limit), JSON parse success, parse failure + fence strip + retry, 2-failure error propagation
- Unit — plan/context_block.go: current week detection, next week inclusion, token cap enforcement, empty plan handling
- Integration — generation pipeline: mock LLM returns valid JSON → plan persisted → retrievable with all sessions
- Integration — S08 hook: assembled prompt includes plan block in correct priority position
- Integration — session completion: mark session completed with actual metrics → reflected in weekly summary
- Edge cases:
  - Race date is less than 4 weeks away → abbreviated plan, warning shown
  - Race date is in the past → wizard blocks creation with validation error
  - LLM returns plan with wrong number of weeks → validation catches mismatch, triggers retry
  - LLM returns prose instead of JSON (even after fence strip) → 3rd failure returns descriptive error to UI
  - Active plan exists when regenerate triggered → old plan archived (not deleted), new plan becomes active
  - Plan block alone exceeds token budget → cap enforced, no panic
  - Athlete has zero historical activities → generation proceeds with profile + race data only; warning shown

## Out of scope

- Automatic session adjustment when Strava activity deviates from plan (smart adaptation engine — separate story)
- Heart-rate-based zone auto-calibration from activity data
- Multi-race periodisation across a full season
- Sharing or exporting the plan as PDF or calendar (.ics)
- Social or coach-review features
- Integration with Garmin / Wahoo to push sessions to devices
