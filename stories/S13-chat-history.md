# S13 — Chat history persistence

## User story

As a **runner**,
I want **my chat conversations saved**
so that **I can review previous coaching sessions**.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Messages persisted to SQLite per session
- [ ] Sessions identified by unique ID + timestamp
- [ ] Previous sessions loadable from history
- [ ] New session created on app launch or explicit action
- [ ] Session list displayed with timestamps
- [ ] Empty state when no previous sessions exist

## Technical notes

Lives in `internal/storage/` for persistence, binding in `app.go`. 
Tables: `chat_sessions` (id, created_at) and `chat_messages` (id, session_id, role, content, created_at). 
Depends on S12 for chat UI.

## Tests required

- Unit: message CRUD, session creation, session listing
- Integration: chat → save → reload
- Edge cases: 1000+ messages, concurrent writes, empty session, corrupted content

## Out of scope

Session search/filtering, export, reactions, sharing
