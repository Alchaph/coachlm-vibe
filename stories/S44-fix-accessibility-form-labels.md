# S44 — Fix accessibility issues with form labels

## User story

As a **user with accessibility needs**,
I want to **form labels to be properly associated with their controls**
so that **screen readers and other assistive technologies can correctly identify form fields**.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] All `<label>` elements have corresponding `for` attributes
- [ ] All form controls have corresponding `id` attributes that match label `for` attributes
- [ ] No A11y warnings during frontend build
- [ ] Forms remain functionally identical after changes
- [ ] Screen reader can properly identify all form fields

## Technical notes

Found in Settings.svelte, Onboarding.svelte, and Context.svelte. Each `<label class="field-label">` needs a `for` attribute pointing to the `id` of its associated form control.

Files to fix:
- `/frontend/src/Settings.svelte`
- `/frontend/src/Onboarding.svelte` 
- `/frontend/src/Context.svelte`

Pattern to apply:
```html
<label class="field-label" for="field-id">Label Text</label>
<input type="text" id="field-id" bind:value={fieldValue} />
```

## Tests required

- Unit: Verify all labels have matching control IDs
- Integration: Test form submission still works
- Accessibility: Screen reader can navigate and identify all form fields

## Out of scope

Adding new ARIA attributes, changing visual styling, adding new form fields
